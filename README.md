# Chess-Arena

Chess-Arena is a **Java-based chess engine and experimentation framework** focused on classical AI search algorithms such as **Minimax and Negamax with Alpha-Beta pruning**.  
The project includes a playable chess implementation with a GUI.

This project was built iteratively with the goal of improving AI playing strength, and performance across multiple versions of the AI.
